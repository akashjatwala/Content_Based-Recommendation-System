The user has to select two files - Train and Test Files. 
Train File will contains the Titles which the user has already watched, whereas Test File will contains the Titles which the user would like to watch.
Maximum Titles in each Files must not exceed 10.
User must only enter Movies/Tv Series Titles and must not mix the Titles, as it would incurr error while execution.
The user will also see a WordCloud of the Genres of the Recommended Titles, and also there is an option to filter out the Recommended Titles based on Genres.
Recommended Titles will show top 5 Titles which matches the user preferences.
Sample Train and Test Files for each Movies and TV Series is also provided.
